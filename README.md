Manage cart, check available delivery options and search for IKEA's item on image.

Currently it is just couple of Python scripts that return raw JSON data.
I will work on improving. But if you wish to see new features or suggestions or want to contributeâ€”feel free to open issue or commit to the project.

## Features
### Cart
- show
- clear
- add/delete items
- get delivery options

### Visual search
Searches for IKEA item on given image. Will return the same result as their website because uses the same API.

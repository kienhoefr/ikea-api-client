Currently it is just couple of Python scripts that return raw JSON data.
I will work on improving. But if you wish to see new features or suggestions or want to contributeâ€”feel free to open issue or commit to the project.
Note that all requests are made for Russian IKEA website. In future I'll add opportunity to change country.
